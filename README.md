Godot Terrain Plugin v 1.1
======================

This is a heightmap-based terrain node for Godot Engine 2.1, written in GDScript.

![Editor screenshot](http://funkyimg.com/i/2tgpb.jpg)This is a SICK mod of Zylann's terrain editor to allow you to use vector painting and alpha painting to slap terrain textures onto your terrain with ease.

Simply select terrain, select vertex paint, choose a combo of colors, choose a brush and off you go.

You no longer need to manually select colors, there are now terrain type icons, simply select the icon and paint your terrain. Easy :)
Optionally you can still paint blends of textures using the 5th button on the top row and the color picker if you like.
